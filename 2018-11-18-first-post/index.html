  <h1 class="post-title">Introduction</h1>
  <span class="post-date">2018-11-18</span>
  <p>As the first post on this blog of mine, I think it's important to introduce myself and talk a little bit about where I
want this blog to go. So, Hello! I'm glad that you have stumbled upon this website of mine and perhaps are here
intentionally. My name is Scott Manifold and I'm a former student of Mathematics who is trying to transition into the
field of Software Development. I've spent my life in the United States and currently call Sourthern California my home.
I also have some interest in other areas like Piano, Go, and Pathfinder, and its hard to forget my 6 years of
Mathematics educations. So there is the possibility these topics might sneak into what I write about. There is a lot to
learn, a long path to travel, but I'm confident that I'll enjoy the trip. As a quick reference, this is me:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.smanifold.com/2018-11-18-first-post/BirthdayMe.jpg" alt="Hi there!" title="My haircut is a lot better now, I swear." /></p>
<p>As a blog, I wanted an outlet to share things I have learned and provide a way to look back at my own journey. I have
always loved talking about new things I've come across, as small as they may be, and and unfortunately my non-tech
friends and family have had to bear this burden for too long. So I felt this was a more constructive outlet, and as I
progress and grow, I can only hope this can grow into something more. At this stage I'm a beginner in more ways than one
so my posts will likely reflect this. But as we progress I aim to improve, and I hope I can help any reader join me in
this.</p>
<p>As a caveat, my background is geared towards numerical work and compiled languages (think C++, Rust, Python), so just
getting this blog working was a small challenge in and of itself. Of course I hope to improve your viewing experience,
but it will take some time for me to get better with Markdown/Html/Sass/Design, so just remember these posts are a
learning experience in and of themselves.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
